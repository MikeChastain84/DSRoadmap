<p><strong>Box plot</strong></p><ul><li>A graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset.</li><li>Displays the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.</li><li>The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which contains the middle 50% of the data.</li><li>The line inside the box represents the median.</li><li>Whiskers extend from the box to indicate the range of the data within the fences.</li><li>Outliers are plotted as individual points beyond the fences.</li></ul><p><strong>Fence</strong></p><ul><li>A cutoff value used in box plots to identify potential outliers.</li><li>Calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) above the upper quartile and below the lower quartile.</li><li>Data points outside the fences are considered potential outliers.</li></ul><p><strong>Whiskers</strong></p><ul><li>Lines extending from the box in a box plot.</li><li>Indicate the range of the data within the fences.</li><li>The upper whisker extends to the largest data point within the upper fence.</li><li>The lower whisker extends to the smallest data point within the lower fence.</li></ul><p><strong>IQR (Interquartile Range)</strong></p><ul><li>The range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).</li><li>Contains the middle 50% of the data.</li><li>Calculated as Q3 - Q1.</li></ul><p><strong>Quartiles</strong></p><ul><li>Values that divide a dataset into four equal parts.</li><li>Q1: The 25th percentile.</li><li>Q2: The median (50th percentile).</li><li>Q3: The 75th percentile.</li></ul><p><strong>Quantiles</strong></p><ul><li>A generalization of quartiles that divide a dataset into any number of equal parts.</li><li>Quartiles are a specific type of quantile.</li><li>Percentiles are another common type of quantile.</li></ul><p><strong>Outliers</strong></p><ul><li>Data points that are significantly different from other observations in the dataset.</li><li>Can be identified using various methods, including box plots and z-scores.</li><li>May indicate errors, unusual events, or simply the natural variability of the data. </li></ul><p><strong>Cardinality</strong></p><ul><li>In the context of data, cardinality refers to the number of unique values in a dataset or a particular column (feature) of a dataset.</li><li>High cardinality means many unique values (e.g., customer IDs, product names).</li><li>Low cardinality means few unique values (e.g., binary categories like gender, boolean values).</li><li>Important for understanding data types, storage efficiency, and potential issues like high-cardinality categorical features in machine learning.</li></ul><p><strong>Features with Constant and Semi-Constant Values</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Constant features</strong>: Have only one unique value in the entire dataset.</li><li><strong>Semi-constant features</strong>: Have a dominant unique value and very few occurrences of other values.</li><li>These features provide little to no information for predictive modeling or analysis.</li><li>Often removed during feature selection to improve model efficiency and prevent overfitting.</li></ul><p><strong>MCAR, MNAR, MAR</strong></p><p>These are types of missing data mechanisms:</p><ul><li><strong>MCAR (Missing Completely at Random)</strong>: The probability of data being missing is unrelated to any observed or unobserved variables. Essentially, missingness occurs entirely by chance.</li><li><strong>MNAR (Missing Not at Random)</strong>: The probability of missingness depends on the missing values themselves. This is the most complex type of missing data, as the missingness is related to the information we don't have.</li><li><strong>MAR (Missing at Random)</strong>: The probability of missingness depends on observed variables but not on the missing values themselves. The missingness can be explained by other information in the data.</li></ul><p><strong>Complete Case Analysis or Listwise Deletion</strong></p><ul><li>A simple method for handling missing data.</li><li>Involves removing any rows (observations) from the dataset that have at least one missing value.</li><li>Can lead to loss of information and biased results if the missing data is not MCAR.</li><li>Suitable when the proportion of missing data is small and MCAR can be reasonably assumed.</li></ul><p><strong>Use of </strong>any<strong> and </strong>all<strong> in a Pandas DataFrame</strong></p><ul><li>any: Returns True if at least one value in a Series or DataFrame meets a certain condition.</li><li>all: Returns True only if all values in a Series or DataFrame meet a certain condition.</li><li>Useful for filtering data, checking for missing values, and performing logical operations on data.</li></ul>
