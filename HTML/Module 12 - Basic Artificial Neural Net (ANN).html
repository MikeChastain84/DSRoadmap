It controls how much the model's parameters (weights and biases) are adjusted during each iteration of the optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent).</p><p>Think of it like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Stepping Stones:</strong> Imagine you're trying to reach the bottom of a valley. The learning rate determines the size of the steps you take.<ul><li><strong>Small Steps:</strong> A small learning rate means you take tiny steps, which can be slow but ensures you don't overstep the bottom.</li><li><strong>Large Steps:</strong> A large learning rate means you take big steps, which can be faster but might cause you to overshoot the bottom and bounce around.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>How it Works</strong></p><p>During training, the neural network calculates the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases. These gradients indicate the direction of the steepest ascent of the loss function. To minimize the loss, we want to move the parameters in the opposite direction (steepest descent).</p><p>The learning rate scales these gradients, determining the step size taken in that direction. The update rule for a parameter (e.g., a weight) typically looks like this:</p><p>weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient</p><p><strong>Choosing the Right Learning Rate</strong></p><p>The choice of learning rate is critical for successful training:</p><ul><li><strong>Too Small:</strong> The network might learn very slowly and get stuck in local minima.</li><li><strong>Too Large:</strong> The network might overshoot the optimal solution, leading to oscillations and instability, or even preventing convergence.</li></ul><p>Finding an appropriate learning rate often involves experimentation and tuning. Common techniques include:</p><ul><li><strong>Start with a moderate value:</strong> A common starting point is 0.1 or 0.01.</li><li><strong>Learning rate schedules:</strong> Gradually decrease the learning rate over time as the training progresses.</li><li><strong>Adaptive learning rates:</strong> Algorithms like Adam or RMSprop automatically adjust the learning rate during training based on the observed gradients.</li></ul><p><strong>In the Code</strong></p><p>In the provided code, the learning_rate is passed as an argument to the NeuralNetwork class and used in the backward method to scale the gradients before updating the weights and biases. This controls how much the parameters are adjusted in each iteration of the training loop.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p><ul><li>The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter that controls the step size in parameter updates during training.</li><li>Choosing an appropriate learning rate is essential for successful training and convergence.</li><li>Experimentation and tuning are often required to find the optimal learning rate for a specific problem and network architecture.</li></ul><h2><a id="_mkkhgx8izgp5"></a>Forward Propagation</h2><p>Forward propagation is the process of passing the input data through the neural network to get the output. It's like a chain reaction, where the output of one layer becomes the input to the next layer.</p><ol><li><strong>Input (X)</strong>: The input data is passed as an argument to the forward method. This data represents the features of the input samples.</li><li><strong>First Hidden Layer</strong><ul><li>np.dot(X, self.weights1) + self.bias1: This calculates the weighted sum of the inputs and the bias for the first hidden layer.

These activations are stored in self.hidden_layer2.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Output Layer</strong><ul><li>np.dot(self.hidden_layer2, self.weights3) + self.bias3: This calculates the weighted sum of the activations from the second hidden layer and the bias for the output layer.</li><li>sigmoid(...): The sigmoid activation function is applied one last time to produce the final output of the network. This output is stored in self.output_layer.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Return Output</strong>: The forward method returns the self.output_layer, which represents the network's prediction for the given input.</li></ol><p><strong>In essence, forward propagation involves:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Weighted Sum:</strong> Calculating the weighted sum of inputs and biases for each layer.</li><li><strong>Activation Function:</strong> Applying an activation function (sigmoid in this case) to introduce non-linearity and produce the activations of the neurons in each layer.</li><li><strong>Passing Activations:</strong> Passing the activations from one layer as input to the next layer.</li></ul><p>This process continues until the final output is generated. The output represents the network's prediction based on the input data and the learned parameters (weights and biases).</p><h2><a id="_i1uu8vuz2jb8"></a>The Sigmoid Function</h2><p>The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that has a characteristic &quot;S&quot;-shaped curve. It's often used as an activation function in neural networks due to its properties that make it well-suited for introducing non-linearity and representing probabilities.</p><p><strong>Mathematical Definition</strong></p><p>The sigmoid function is defined as:</p><p>sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))</p><p>where:</p><ul><li>x is the input to the function.</li><li>exp(-x) is the exponential of the negative input.</li></ul><p><strong>Properties</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Non-linearity:</strong> The sigmoid function is non-linear, meaning its output is not a straight line. This non-linearity is crucial for neural networks to learn complex patterns and relationships in data.</li><li><strong>Output Range:</strong> The output of the sigmoid function is always between 0 and 1. This makes it useful for representing probabilities or activation levels of neurons.</li><li><strong>Smoothness:</strong> The sigmoid function is smooth and differentiable, meaning it has a well-defined derivative at all points. This is important for training neural networks using gradient-based optimization algorithms.</li><li><strong>Monotonicity:</strong> The sigmoid function is monotonic, meaning it's always increasing. This can help with stability during training.</li></ul><p><strong>How it Works in Neural Networks</strong></p><p>In neural networks, the sigmoid function is typically used as an activation function. It takes the weighted sum of inputs and biases for a neuron and produces an output between 0 and 1. This output represents the activation level of the neuron.</p><ul><li><strong>Low Input:</strong> If the weighted sum is a large negative value, the sigmoid function outputs a value close to 0, indicating low activation.</li><li><strong>High Input:</strong> If the weighted sum is a large positive value, the sigmoid function outputs a value close to 1, indicating high activation.</li></ul><p><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Probability Representation:</strong> The output range of 0 to 1 makes it suitable for representing probabilities.</li><li><strong>Smoothness:</strong> Its differentiability allows for gradient-based optimization.</li><li><strong>Interpretability:</strong> The output can be interpreted as an activation level or a probability.</li></ul><p><strong>Limitations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Vanishing Gradients:</strong> For very large positive or negative inputs, the derivative of the sigmoid function becomes very small. This can lead to the vanishing gradient problem, making it difficult to train deep networks.</li><li><strong>Not Zero-Centered:</strong> The output of the sigmoid function is not zero-centered, which can sometimes hinder the learning process.</li></ul><p><strong>Alternatives</strong></p><p>Due to its limitations, other activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and tanh (hyperbolic tangent) are often preferred in modern deep learning architectures.</p><p><strong>In Summary</strong></p><p>The sigmoid function is a non-linear activation function commonly used in neural networks. It squashes the input to a range between 0 and 1, making it suitable for representing probabilities and introducing non-linearity. However, it has limitations like vanishing gradients and not being zero-centered, which have led to the adoption of alternative activation functions in many cases.</p><h2><a id="_59hvea1qoyq"></a>Backward Propagation</h2><p>Backpropagation is the heart of how neural networks learn. It's the algorithm that calculates how much each weight and bias in the network contributes to the overall error, and then updates those parameters accordingly to improve the network's accuracy.</p><ol><li><strong>Calculate the Error</strong><ul><li>output_error = y - output: This calculates the difference between the predicted output (output) from the forward pass and the actual target output (y). This difference represents the error of the network.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Propagate the Error Backwards</strong><ul><li>The error is propagated back through the network, layer by layer, in reverse order. This is done by calculating the gradients of the error with respect to the weights and biases of each layer.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Calculate Gradients for the Output Layer</strong><ul><li>d_output = output_error * sigmoid_derivative(output): This calculates the gradient of the error with respect to the output layer's activations.

It refers to the process of moving the error signal from the output layer back through the hidden layers to the input layer. This is done to figure out how much each weight and bias in the network contributed to the overall error.</p><ol><li><strong>Start at the Output:</strong> The process begins by calculating the error at the output layer. This error represents the difference between the network's prediction and the actual target value.</li><li><strong>Chain Reaction:</strong> The error is then propagated back through the network, layer by layer, like a chain reaction. At each layer, we calculate how much of the error from the previous layer is attributed to the current layer's activations.</li><li><strong>Using the Chain Rule:</strong> The chain rule from calculus is used to calculate these error attributions. It essentially tells us how much a small change in a neuron's activation affects the overall error.</li><li><strong>Calculating Gradients:</strong> By propagating the error backward and applying the chain rule, we calculate the gradients of the error with respect to each weight and bias in the network. These gradients indicate the direction and magnitude of the influence of each parameter on the error.</li><li><strong>Updating Parameters:</strong> Finally, the gradients are used to update the weights and biases in a way that reduces the error. This is typically done using an optimization algorithm like gradient descent.</li></ol><p><strong>Analogy</strong></p><p>Imagine a team working on a project where the final outcome has an error. To improve, they need to figure out where things went wrong:</p><ul><li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> The team responsible for the final output identifies the error.</li><li><strong>Propagating Backwards:</strong> They communicate the error to the teams responsible for the previous steps.</li><li><strong>Identifying Contributions:</strong> Each team analyzes how their work contributed to the error.</li><li><strong>Adjusting Work:</strong> Based on this analysis, each team adjusts their work to reduce their contribution to the error.</li></ul><p><strong>In the Code</strong></p><p>In the backward method, the lines like hidden_error2 = d_output.dot(self.weights3.T) and hidden_error1 = d_hidden2.dot(self.weights2.T) are performing this error propagation. They calculate how much of the error from the subsequent layer is attributed to the activations of the current layer.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong></p><p>Propagating the error backwards is essential for training neural networks. It allows the network to identify how each parameter contributes to the error and adjust those parameters accordingly to improve its performance. This process is what enables the network to learn from the data and make more accurate predictions.</p><h2><a id="_iazkojpbvbwa"></a>Sigmoid Derivative</h2><p>The sigmoid derivative plays a crucial role in the backpropagation algorithm used to train neural networks.
