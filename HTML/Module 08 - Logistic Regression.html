<p>A glossary of terms and concepts from the document you provided is presented below.</p><ul><li><strong>Logistic Regression<br /></strong><ul><li>A statistical model that models the probability of an event taking place by having the log-odds for the event be a linear combination of one or more independent variables.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sigmoid<br /></strong><ul><li>A sigmoid curve is a common S-shaped curve that is often used in statistics to represent cumulative distribution functions. Sigmoid curves are bound by 0 and 1 on the y-axis and have a probability of 0.5 at the midpoint, or x=0.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Threshold<br /></strong><ul><li>In logistic regression, a classification threshold, also called the decision threshold, is the value logistic regression uses to map a logistic regression value to a binary category. A logistic regression model that returns 0.9995 for a particular email message is predicting that it is very likely to be spam.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Probability<br /></strong><ul><li>The probability is the number of observed outcomes divided by the possible outcomes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Odds<br /></strong><ul><li>The odds are what happened divided by what didn't happen. We take the odds to make the value continuous.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Log Odds<br /></strong><ul><li>The log of the odds is used to get a range from negative infinity to infinity. We take the odds ratio to get a parameter estimate and take the log of that ratio to make the variable range from negative infinity to infinity and be symmetric around 0 instead of 1.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Euler's Number<br /></strong><ul><li>Euler's number is often used as the base of an exponential. The derivative of the function y=ex is equal to itself. Euler's number is often used in machine learning.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Logistic Function<br /></strong><ul><li>A logistic function is often used in logistic regression to model how the probability of an event may be affected by one or more explanatory variables. An example would be to have the model p=f(a+bx), where x is the explanatory variable, a and b are model parameters to be fitted, and f is the standard logistic function: p=1+e−(β0​+β1​x)1​</li></ul></li><li><strong>Logistic Model<br /></strong><ul><li>In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is a statistical model that models the probability of an event taking place by having the log-odds for the event be a linear combination of one or more independent variables.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Logit<br /></strong><ul><li>A Logit function, the inverse of the logistic sigmoid, also known as the log-odds function, is a function that represents probability values from 0 to 1, and negative infinity to infinity.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sigmoid vs. Logit<br /></strong><ul><li>The inverse of the logit curve is the inverse-logit or sigmoid function. The sigmoid function transforms the numbers (-∞ to +∞) back to values between 0 and 1. </li></ul></li></ul>
