They determine the strength and direction of the relationship between a feature and the outcome.</li><li><strong>Standard Error:</strong> This measures the accuracy of your coefficient estimates. A smaller standard error means your coefficient estimate is likely more precise.</li><li><strong>t-statistic:</strong> This value helps determine the significance of your coefficients. It's calculated by dividing the coefficient by its standard error. A larger absolute t-value suggests the feature is a more significant predictor.</li><li><strong>p-value:</strong> This indicates the probability of observing the given t-value if there were no real relationship between the feature and the outcome. A small p-value (typically &lt; 0.05) suggests that the feature is statistically significant in predicting the outcome.</li><li><strong>Confidence Intervals:</strong> These provide a range within which the true population coefficient is likely to fall (with a certain level of confidence, e.g., 95%).<br /></li></ul><p><strong>How They Contribute to Predicting 'y'</strong></p><p>In a linear regression model, the outcome 'y' is predicted using an equation like this:</p><p>y = β0 + β1*x1 + β2*x2 + ... + βn*xn</p><ul><li>β0 is the intercept (the value of y when all features are 0)</li><li>β1, β2, ... βn are the coefficients for each feature</li><li>x1, x2, ... xn are the values of your features</li></ul><p>The coefficients, guided by their significance (t-value, p-value) and confidence intervals, determine how much each feature contributes to the final prediction of 'y'.</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><p>Let's imagine a model predicting house prices ('y') based on features like size (x1) and location (x2):</p><ul><li>Coefficient for size (β1) = 1000</li><li>Coefficient for location (β2) = 50000</li></ul><p>This means that:</p><ul><li>For every 1 unit increase in size, the house price is predicted to increase by 1000 units (holding location constant).</li><li>For a 1 unit increase in the location's desirability score, the house price is predicted to increase by 50000 units (holding size constant).</li></ul><p>The standard error, t-value, p-value, and confidence intervals would further refine these estimates, indicating the precision and significance of these relationships.</p>
