<p>There are several terms and concepts explained throughout the document you provided. Here is a brief definition and explanation for each:</p><p><strong>Intercept</strong> In linear regression, the intercept is the value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero. It can be thought of as the starting point of the regression line.</p><p><strong>Classification (Logistic Regression)</strong> A statistical method used to predict the probability of a binary outcome (yes or no, true or false).</p><p><strong>Decision Tree</strong> A decision support tool that uses a tree-like model to map decisions and their possible consequences.</p><p><strong>Decision Tree Terms</strong></p><ul><li>Root Node: The initial node in the decision tree.</li><li>Decision Node: A node in a decision tree where a decision is made based on a feature.</li><li>Splitting: Dividing a node into sub-nodes based on a decision rule.</li><li>Leaf/Terminal Node: A node with no children or sub-nodes.</li><li>Branch: A section of a decision tree connecting nodes.</li><li>Pruning: Eliminating branches and nodes to simplify the tree.</li><li>Parent / Children: The relationship between nodes and their sub-nodes.</li></ul><p><strong>Splitting Trees</strong> The process of dividing a node in a decision tree into two or more sub-nodes based on a feature, aiming to increase information gain or reduce uncertainty.</p><p><strong>Information Gain</strong> A metric used to measure the reduction in entropy (uncertainty) achieved by splitting a dataset based on a specific feature.</p><p><strong>Gini Impurity</strong> A measure of the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element from a set.</p><p><strong>Entropy</strong> A measure of uncertainty or disorder in a dataset. In decision trees, it is used to determine the optimal splits.</p><p><strong>Gain Ratio</strong> A modification of information gain used in decision trees to select the best feature to split on.</p><p><strong>Random Forests</strong> An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.</p><p><strong>Ensemble Learning</strong> A machine-learning approach where multiple models are combined to solve a problem.</p><p><strong>Hyperparameters</strong> Parameters used to control the learning process of a machine learning model, typically set before training begins.</p><p><strong>Grid Search</strong> A method for hyperparameter tuning where different combinations of hyperparameters are tested, and the combination with the best performance is selected.</p><p><strong>Cross-Validation</strong> A technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model on unseen data by partitioning the data into subsets for training and testing. </p>
