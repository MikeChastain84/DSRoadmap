<p>Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) extend the traditional linear regression model to accommodate a wider range of response variables beyond continuous data. A key component of a GLM is the <strong>link function</strong>, which establishes a relationship between the linear predictor (a linear combination of predictor variables) and the expected value of the response variable.</p><p>Here's a list of common link functions and their purposes:</p><p><strong>1. Identity Link:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Models the expected value of the response variable directly as the linear predictor.</li><li><strong>Common Use:</strong> Used for continuous response variables with a normal distribution, essentially making the GLM equivalent to ordinary least squares regression.</li><li><strong>Mathematical Form:</strong> g(μ) = μ</li></ul><p><strong>2. Log Link:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Models the logarithm of the expected value of the response variable. This ensures the predicted values are always positive.</li><li><strong>Common Use:</strong> Often used for count data (Poisson regression) or continuous positive data with right-skewed distributions.</li><li><strong>Mathematical Form:</strong> g(μ) = log(μ)</li></ul><p><strong>3. Logit Link:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Models the log-odds (logit) of the probability of an event. This constrains the predicted probabilities to lie between 0 and 1.</li><li><strong>Common Use:</strong> The standard link function for binary response variables (logistic regression).</li><li><strong>Mathematical Form:</strong> g(μ) = log(μ / (1 - μ))</li></ul><p><strong>4. Probit Link:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Similar to the logit link, it models the inverse of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.</li><li><strong>Common Use:</strong> Also used for binary response variables, often when there's an underlying latent variable with a normal distribution.</li><li><strong>Mathematical Form:</strong> g(μ) = Φ⁻¹(μ), where Φ⁻¹ is the inverse of the standard normal CDF.</li></ul><p><strong>5. Complementary Log-Log Link:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Models the log of the negative log of the complementary probability (1 - probability of event).</li><li><strong>Common Use:</strong> Suitable for binary response data, particularly when the probability of an event is very low or very high. Also used in survival analysis.</li><li><strong>Mathematical Form:</strong> g(μ) = log(-log(1 - μ))</li></ul><p><strong>6. Inverse Link:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Models the inverse of the expected value of the response variable.</li><li><strong>Common Use:</strong> Often used for response variables with a gamma distribution.</li><li><strong>Mathematical Form:</strong> g(μ) = 1 / μ</li></ul><p><strong>7. Square Root Link:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Models the square root of the expected value of the response variable.</li><li><strong>Common Use:</strong> Can be used for count data with a Poisson distribution when variance increases faster than the mean.</li><li><strong>Mathematical Form:</strong> g(μ) = √μ</li></ul><p><strong>Choosing the Right Link Function:</strong></p><p>The choice of link function depends on:</p><ul><li><strong>The nature of the response variable:</strong> Whether it's continuous, binary, count, etc.</li><li><strong>The distribution of the response variable:</strong> Normal, Poisson, binomial, gamma, etc.</li><li><strong>The desired interpretation of the model coefficients:</strong> How changes in the predictor variables affect the response variable.</li></ul><p>It's important to note that the link function is a crucial part of the GLM specification. Choosing an inappropriate link function can lead to biased estimates and incorrect inferences.</p>
