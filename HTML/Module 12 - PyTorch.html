<p>I found the following definitions and explanations for terms and concepts in this document.</p><p><strong>CPUs, T4 GPUs, and TPU v2-8s</strong></p><ul><li>These are different types of processors with varying strengths and weaknesses. CPUs are general-purpose processors, T4 GPUs are parallel processors well-suited for deep learning, and TPU v2-8s are custom-designed processors specifically for machine learning and AI workloads.</li></ul><p><strong>Input Layer</strong></p><ul><li>The input layer is the first layer of the neural network. It receives the input data and passes it to the next layer.</li></ul><p><strong>Hidden Layers</strong></p><ul><li>Hidden layers are intermediate layers between the input and output layers. They perform computations and learn representations of the data.</li></ul><p><strong>Output Layer</strong></p><ul><li>The output layer produces the final result or prediction of the neural network.</li></ul><p><strong>Neurons</strong></p><ul><li>Neurons are the fundamental processing units of a neural network. They receive input, perform a computation, and produce an output.</li></ul><p><strong>Training Loop</strong></p><ul><li>The training loop is the iterative process of feeding data to the neural network, calculating the error, and updating the network's parameters to improve its performance.</li></ul><p><strong>Forward Pass</strong></p><ul><li>The forward pass is the process of passing the input data through the network to generate a prediction.</li></ul><p><strong>Loss Calculation</strong></p><ul><li>The loss calculation involves determining the difference between the predicted output and the actual target output.</li></ul><p><strong>Backward Pass and Optimization</strong></p><ul><li>The backward pass calculates the gradients of the loss with respect to the network's parameters. The optimizer then updates these parameters to minimize the loss.</li></ul><p><strong>Epochs</strong></p><ul><li>An epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset during the training process.</li></ul><p><strong>Predictions</strong></p><ul><li>Predictions are the outputs generated by the neural network when given new input data.</li></ul><p>torch.Tensor</p><ul><li>In PyTorch, a torch.Tensor is a multi-dimensional array that serves as the fundamental building block for all operations and models. It is similar to a NumPy array but with added functionalities for deep learning, such as GPU support and automatic differentiation.</li></ul><p><strong>Automatic Differentiation</strong></p><ul><li>Automatic differentiation is a technique used to automatically calculate the gradients of functions, which is crucial for training neural networks.</li></ul><p>torch.nn<strong> Module</strong></p><ul><li>The torch.nn module in PyTorch provides a collection of pre-built layers, activation functions, and other components for constructing neural networks.</li></ul><p><strong>Loss Function</strong></p><ul><li>A loss function measures the difference between the network's predictions and the actual target values, quantifying the error the network makes.</li></ul><p>nn.MSELoss()</p><ul><li>This creates an instance of the MSELoss class from PyTorch's nn module, representing the Mean Squared Error Loss, commonly used for regression tasks.</li></ul><p><strong>Optimizer</strong></p><ul><li>An optimizer is an algorithm that adjusts the network's parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the loss function.</li></ul><p>optim.SGD(...)</p><ul><li>This creates an instance of the SGD class from PyTorch's optim module, representing Stochastic Gradient Descent, a widely used optimization algorithm.</li></ul><p><strong>Learning Rate (</strong>lr<strong>)</strong></p><ul><li>The learning rate controls the step size taken in the direction of the negative gradient during each iteration of the optimization process.</li></ul>
