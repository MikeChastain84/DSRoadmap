<h3><a id="_rk93jvfdvpkx"></a><strong>Fundamentals</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)</strong>: GLMs are a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution.</li></ul><h3><a id="_fcrlwvgqgzkd"></a><strong>Regression and Modeling</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Polynomial Regression</strong>: Polynomial regression extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms (squared, cubed, etc.) to the model, allowing it to capture non-linear relationships.</li><li><strong>Step Function</strong>: A function that increases or decreases abruptly from one constant value to another.</li><li><strong>Basis Functions</strong>: Basis functions are a set of functions used to represent or approximate other functions. Examples include polynomials, splines, and wavelets.</li><li><strong>Splines</strong>: Splines are piecewise polynomial functions used to create smooth curves. They're useful for interpolating data and approximating complex relationships.</li><li><strong>Smoothing Splines</strong>: Smoothing splines are similar to splines, but they aim to approximate the data without necessarily passing through every data point, which is useful for noisy data.</li><li><strong>Local Regression (LOESS)</strong>: A method that fits a separate regression model to localized subsets of the data, creating a smooth curve by combining these local models.</li></ul><h3><a id="_t8fn2fqopeuh"></a><strong>Link Functions</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Link Functions</strong>: A link function is a function that connects the linear predictor in a GLM to the expected value of the response variable. Examples include the identity link (for simple linear regression) and the logit link (for logistic regression).<ul><li><strong>Linear</strong>: η(μ)=μ.</li><li><strong>Logistic</strong>: η(μ)=log(μ/(1−μ)).</li><li><strong>Poisson</strong>: η(μ)=log(μ).</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a id="_lytgcx8ca4so"></a><strong>Families</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Gaussian (Normal)</strong>: Used for continuous data that is normally distributed.</li><li><strong>Binomial</strong>: Used for binary data (e.g., success/failure, presence/absence) or count data where the number of trials is fixed.</li><li><strong>Poisson</strong>: Used for count data where the events occur independently at a constant rate (e.g., the number of customers arriving at a store per hour).</li><li><strong>Gamma</strong>: Used for continuous positive data that is skewed (e.g., income, waiting times).</li><li><strong>Inverse Gaussian</strong>: Used for continuous positive data with a specific type of skewness.</li></ul><h3><a id="_uvwhkm9v34u6"></a><strong>Other Important Concepts</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)</strong>: A method for estimating unknown parameters (like the probability of heads in a coin flip) by finding the parameter values that make the observed data most likely.</li><li><strong>Bayesian Approach</strong>: An alternative to MLE that incorporates prior knowledge or beliefs about the parameters being estimated.</li><li><strong>Local Minimum</strong>: A point in a function where the function has the lowest value in its immediate neighborhood.</li><li><strong>Global Minimum</strong>: The absolute lowest point in the entire function.</li></ul>
